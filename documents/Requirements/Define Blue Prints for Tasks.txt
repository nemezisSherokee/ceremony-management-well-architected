EPIC : Blue prints for importants part of our systems and with differents programming languages

US - Description: Define a Java Blue print for a Lambda function

As a AWS Developper 

I want to have ready to use Lambda Java blue print

So That I can directly start writing adding a feature to my solution
------------------------------------------------

Pre-Condition

	-	Have a CodeBuild Blue print ready to use

----------------- 

Post Condition:

	-	The Java Blue Blue print muss be written in Java  and sould be deployed uppon any change
		
		Given an InteliJ IDE
		When I open my blue print project 
		Then I should se a well architected project that can be extended

SCOPE:
	- 	A Jaba project  is created
	- 	An Helloword function is defined and TDD must be applied
	- 	Unit Test must be passed
	
Attachements

US - Description: Add Cucumber facility to our Java Blue Print 

As a AWS Developper 

I want  to be start making BDD with Cucumber to my Blue Print 

So That I Be sure that the rigth functionality is alway developed
------------------------------------------------

Pre-Condition

	-	Have a Ready to use Java Blue print

----------------- 

Post Condition:

	- 	The Java Blue print has a cucumber enabled
		
		Given a Java Blue Print
		When I Call maven package
		Then The project must build and cucumber must start.
		
	- 	The Java Blue print has a SonarQube enabled
		
		Given a Java Blue print
		When I call the solar runner
		Then The project must build and SonarQube must give result of the check

	-	The Blue Print must be deployed to the Lambda Service
		Given a Java Blue Print
		When change a code to the Java and push to the repository
		Then an according CodeBuild project must start and the every part of the build (BDD, SonarQube) must passt and the Lambda function must be deployed
		

SCOPE:
	- 	A Java project with Cucumber facilities is available
	- 	An Helloword function is defined and TDD must be applied
	- 	BDD Tests must be passed
