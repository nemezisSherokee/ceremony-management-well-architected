US - Description: Configure a Gitlab repository

As a DevOps Engineer

I want to configure a Gitlab Repository

So That I can manage version of my workload
------------------------------------------------

Pre-Condition

	-	Have a gitlab Account

----------------- 

Post Condition:

	-	The Repository can be cloned with ssh
		
		Given an SSH public key
		When I have the repository link and enter git clone ssh://john@example.com/path/to/my-project.git
		Then I get get the repository localy downloaded
		
	- 	The Git workflow should be git flow
		
		Given a download repository
		When I install the gitflow system and enter the command git flow init
		Then The gitflow must have been initialised.
		
	-	The Master Branch is locked and can only be changed with pull/merge request
		Given the repository
		When I push to a master branch
		I should have an errors telling, that I cannot push directly to the master branch
		

SCOPE:
	- 	A Repository is created
	- 	A PullRequest condition is created in the master Branch
	- 	The Gitflow package is localy installed

US - Description: define the CI/CD pipeline on AWS

As a DevOps Engineer

I want to configure a CodePipeline Project

So That I start building the project on any change on the master branch


Pre-Condition

	-	A gitlab repository has been configured

----------------- 

Post-Condition:

	-	A Code pipeline project is created
		
		Given a gitlab repository
		When A Pull request is accepted and and I know the adress of CI/CD pipeline
		Then a webhook triggers the pipeline
		
	- 	The Pipeline Build is only triggered when changed are made to a specific directory
		
		Given Copepipeline
		When somechanges are made to a specfic directory
		Then a specific lambda function starts the CodeBuild project
		 

SCOPE:
	- 	A Codepipeline project is created
	- 	A Webhook is triggered from Gitlab
	- 	A Lambda function is created 
	
Attachements
	- 	Event-driven architecture for using third-party Git repositories as source for AWS CodePipeline

Pre-Condition

	-	A Example of CI/CD is created

----------------- 

Post-Condition:

	- 	The Lambda function is packaged on S3
		
		Given a Lambda function that checks if a codeBuild project should be started
		When When I run aws cloudformation package AND provide a s3 bucket
		Then an output template is generated

	-	A Cloudformation template is created
		
		Given necessary inputs for the CI/CD pipeline
		When I run cloudmation deploy
		Then my CI/CD codepipeline project on AWS is created
				 

SCOPE:
	- 	A create a first cloudformation template
	- 	A package lambda function
